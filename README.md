## Overview

This project is a multi-page website developed for a home textile business. It is the largest solo project I have undertaken so far. The client gave me complete creative freedom for the design, including colors and fonts. I also redesigned the client's old logo, revamped all their images, and, with their assistance, produced a short promo video.

## Features

- **Logo Redesign**: Updated the old logo to a modern design.
- **Promo Video**: Created a short promotional video for the client.
- **Multiple Galleries**: Used Venobox plugin for elegant image galleries.
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented with Lozad.js library to handle the heavy image and content load.
- **Modern Hero Section**: Utilized SwiperJS for a dynamic carousel in the hero section.
- **SEO Optimized**: Following best practices to ensure the site is search engine friendly.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive to ensure a seamless experience across all devices.
- **WebP Images**: All images are in WebP format for faster loading times and better performance.
- **Hashless URLs**: Implemented hash removal from URLs for cleaner navigation.
